            <h1>Project processes</h1>
            <h3>Stage 1: Pitching</h3>
            <p>We will open up submissions for pitches monthly requiring a working title alongside a 300 word concept narrative. What is the inspiration for it? What does it disrupt and challenge? Attach a mood board with frame references and visual inspiration or a first draft of a screenplay. You will know the outcome of your pitch within 48hours.  If we give it the green light - congrats! We’re ready to move on to securing a Creative Team, sending over the concept narrative and mood board to all DISRUPTION members. We will then decide which individuals will represent their team and an ad-hoc Teams channel under the working title of the project will be created.
            </p>
            <h3>Stage 2: Conceptualising</h3>
            <p>Communicating through the ad hoc Teams Channel for the project, the team will turn to shared google slides. The Creative Assistants, Photographer(s) and Videographer(s) will each add a slide with frame references and visual inspiration. The Fashion Director will add a slide with the work of designers scouted online. The Head Stylist will add a styling mood board and the Head of Set Design will add a set design mood board. The Movement Director will add a slide containing ideas and inspiration. During a Creative Team meeting, each individual will talk through their slides. The Creative Director will then pull the best visual inspiration together to create final mood boards
                . </p>
            <h3>Stage 3: Execution</h3>
            <p>Once equipment, props, talent, looks, stylists, set designers, composers, artists and graphic designers are secured, shooting can begin! Logistics must be established: timings, locations, transporting of props, equipment and clothing. The project day involves a healthy amount of chaos and experimenting but it is incredibly fulfilling seeing hard work translate into an electric experience on set.
            </p>
            <h3>Stage 4: Post-Production</h3>
            <p>Photography & Video Team will edit all content; the Music Team will produce soundtracks; and the Arts & Graphics and Writers’ Team will produce graphics for edited photos or articles/poetry to accompany a shoot. The Digital & Social Media Team will launch the project on the DISRUPTION site and social media channels. The Events Team will organise a ‘new pathway’ launch party working with the Arts & Graphics Team, Music Team and Social Media Team to promote the event and secure DJs/bands/art installations for the party.
            </p>
            <h3>Stage 5: Shadowing and mentoring</h3>
            <p>When a project is announced, there will be opportunities for shadowing. Each Creative Team role will have up to 2 spaces for shadowing. If chosen, you will assist your mentor, sit in on meetings and witness the development of the project. No experience is needed to shadow.
                Why are we doing this?
                We want to develop new talent and bring in creatives with fresh perspectives and unique ideas.
                We want to build a system that doesn’t disproportionately benefit those who are already advantaged through their greater access to creative opportunities. The programme will ensure those who don’t have experience have a means to gain it and so have access to the roles on offer.
